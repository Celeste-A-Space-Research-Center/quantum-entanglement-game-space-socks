# Quantum Entanglement Game
## Game Name: Space Socks
## Genre: Educational
## Description:
Quantum Computing is the future. However, like the popular phrase goes “It’s simple, it’s not quantum mechanics”- there is a misconception that the quantum world is too complicated for everyone to understand. 

While the quantum world is truly vastly different from our everyday universe, it hosts potential to transform the future and it is crucial to clear these misconceptions and instill a basic and fundamental understanding of quantum concepts to pave the path for the future of quantum computing.

According to Boston Consulting Group’s projection, quantum computing will create $450 billion to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. The quantum computing future is here and the world needs to be equipped for it.

Our endeavors to support this cause was to gamify the approach of quantum entanglement and quantum hotspots. 

Taking the popular example of Prof.Bertlmann's mismatched socks to illustrate quantum entanglement, **Space Socks** is a single-player game that simulates quantum entanglement and teleportation.

## Quantum Entanglement:
Quantum entanglement is one of the most profound yet confusing aspects of quantum mechanics. When two particles are in entangled quantum states, measuring a property of one of the particles reveals information about the other particle without even needing to check.

If I have a pair of socks- one left and one right and I send my friend Bob a sock, we can call this pair of socks entangled. Without checking what sock I have, if Bob checks the sock I sent him- he automatically knows about my sock. If Bob received a left sock, I must have a right sock and vice versa.

## The game involves:

* The transmitter (Alice) placed at a stationary point called the point of reference to understand relative speed of satellite rotation and entanglement.
* The teleporter (A satellite) made to rotate around the earth at a speed that equals the optimum time taken to run a quantum teleportation circuit on the accessible quantum processors and simulators (viz, IBM's qasm).
* The receiver (Bob) made to rotate around the earth in a spaceship around the earth at a speed that equals the optimum time taken to run a quantum teleportation circuit.
* 3 pairs each of red- and yellow-colored socks rotating consecutively around the earth at a speed matching the time taken to run the teleportation circuit 

By building a proper circuit and playing the game well, you can help Alice send a message to Bob maintaining quantum entanglement. And boom- now you too understand quantum circuits, quantum entanglement and essentially how the quantum world works. Maybe we’re one step closer to flipping the saying from **“It’s simple, it’s not quantum mechanics”** to **“It’s as simple as quantum mechanics”**.
## How to Play:
#### Objective:
The primary objective is to help Alice send her message to Bob by selecting the appropriate quantum circuit (lines), adjusting angles and distances, and choosing the correct quantum gate to maintain the entanglement. Success is measured by delivering the message without disruption.

#### Controls:
* **Build your Teleportation Circuit**: Teleport your message with the colour of sock that you intend to let Bob know about, as shown in the demo video. Hit on the green **Run** button, and voila, you can proceed once you succeed. This is the start of your quantum communication action.
* **Select your Line**: Successful building of the quantum circuit will activate the sock you have chosen, and also the **Line**,**Angle** and **Distance** boxes.Choose the line that Alice's message will travel along. You can select a line either by typing the line number (e.g., Line 1, Line 2) or clicking on the line directly using the mouse.

* **Input the angle**: After selecting a line, input the angle (θ) at which the message should travel. The angle is essential in determining the trajectory. You can enter the angle using the keyboard, or adjust using the on-screen controls.

* **Input the distance**: After the angle is set, input the distance the message will travel along the line.Similar to the angle, input this value via the keyboard or on-screen controls.
