# Description:
Quantum Computing is the future. However, like the popular phrase goes “It’s simple, it’s not quantum mechanics”- there is a misconception that the quantum world is too complicated for everyone to understand. 

While the quantum world is truly vastly different from our everyday universe, it hosts potential to transform the future and it is crucial to clear these misconceptions and instill a basic and fundamental understanding of quantum concepts to pave the path for the future of quantum computing.

According to Boston Consulting Group’s projection, quantum computing will create $450 billion to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. The quantum computing future is here and the world needs to be equipped for it.

Our endeavors to support this cause was to gamify the approach of quantum entanglement and quantum hotspots. 

Taking the popular example of Prof.Bertlmann's mismatched socks to illustrate quantum entanglement, Space Socks is a single-player game that simulates quantum entanglement required as a part of teleportation.

# Quantum Entanglement:
Quantum entanglement is one of the most profound yet confusing aspects of quantum mechanics. When two particles are in entangled quantum states, measuring a property of one of the particles reveals information about the other particle without even needing to check.

If I have a pair of socks- one left and one right and I send my friend Bob a sock, we can call this pair of socks entangled. Without checking what sock I have, if Bob checks the sock I sent him- he automatically knows about my sock. If Bob received a left sock, I must have a right sock and vice versa.

# The game involves:
• The transmitter (Alice) placed at a stationary point called the point of reference to understand relative speed of satellite rotation and entanglement.
• The teleporter (A satellite) made to rotate around the earth at a speed that equals the optimum time taken to run a quantum teleportation circuit on the accessible quantum processors and simulators (viz, IBM's qasm).
•The receiver (Bob) made to rotate around the earth in a spaceship around the earth at a speed that equals the optimum time taken to run a quantum teleportation circuit.
•3 pairs each of red- and yellow-colored socks rotating consecutively around the earth at a speed matching the time taken to run the teleportation circuit 

By building a proper circuit and playing the game well, you can help Alice send a message to Bob maintaining quantum entanglement. And boom- now you too understand quantum circuits, quantum entanglement and essentially how the quantum world works. Maybe we’re one step closer to flipping the saying from “It’s simple, it’s not quantum mechanics” to “It’s as simple as quantum mechanics”.
