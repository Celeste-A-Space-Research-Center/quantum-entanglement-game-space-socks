# Description:
Quantum Computing is the future. However, like the popular phrase goes “It’s simple, it’s not quantum mechanics”- there is a misconception that the quantum world is too complicated for everyone to understand. 

While the quantum world is truly vastly different from our everyday universe, it hosts potential to transform the future and it is crucial to clear these misconceptions and instill a basic and fundamental understanding of quantum concepts to pave the path for the future of quantum computing.

According to Boston Consulting Group’s projection, quantum computing will create $450 billion to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. The quantum computing future is here and the world needs to be equipped for it.

Our endeavors to support this cause was to gamify the approach of quantum entanglement and quantum hotspots. 

Taking the popular example of Prof.Bertlmann's mismatched socks to illustrate quantum entanglement, Space Socks is a single-player game that simulates quantum entanglement required as a part of teleportation.

# Quantum Entanglement:
Quantum entanglement is one of the most profound yet confusing aspects of quantum mechanics. When two particles are in entangled quantum states, measuring a property of one of the particles reveals information about the other particle without even needing to check.
